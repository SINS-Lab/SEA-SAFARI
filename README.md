# Sea-Safari

This software is for simulating scattering of low and hyperthermal energy ions off solid surfaces. It is a continuation of SAFARI, which filled the same role, however was limited to specific crystal faces.

This version of Safari allows using an arbitrary input crystal, and is optimized for working on larger sized crystals than the old one, as a result, it runs much faster for larger crystals, however uses significantly more RAM.

Unlike SAFARI, this version only outputs to an ascii file, and also includes the entire lattice in the xyz output, instead of just the interacting atoms.
