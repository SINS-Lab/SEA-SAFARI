# The first number is how many parameters there are,

#   1 - double exponential function - has 4 parameters per lattice atom type.
#       this is of form: a * exp(-b * r) + c * exp(-d * r)

#
#   [a] = eV
#   [b] = 1/Angstrom

#
# The third parameter is the type of inter-lattice forces to use
#
#   0 - default if not present, use einstien springs
#   1 - Use springs between nearest neighbours
#   2 - Use lennard Jones, in this case,

# If the 4th parameter is t, then an existing crystal will be loaded.
# The existing crystal needs to be in a file with extension "crys_in", with
# the same name as the input file.
# the crystal loading is enabled, then 3 more parameters are also needed.
# These are to define the surface face of the loaded crystal, to be used
# to rotate the crystal to the requested surface face.
